<h1>Bright Star—— John Keats</h1>
<p>
Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art---
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And Watching, with eternal lids apart,<br>
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,<br>
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,<br>
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors
No-yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,<br>
Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast </h1> </p>
